### ideas

- python, bash, PHP ?
- global eg can call from anywhere ( will use current dir if has composer.json)
- remember projects (add projects) update all at once
- looks nice (cli output)
- uses tests (drupal core ? codeception ?)
- not dependent on drupal ( dont run drush commands)
- not dependent on lando ? (we assume lando)
- maybe have conf per project eg name location uses lando has tests ?
- handle errors ( rollback ?) eg update module but patch breaks then revert
- handle patch updates (drupal ?) can this even be done ?
- no user checks ( "auto",  yolo, -y) mode
- grab release notes display in cli ?
- Collab with Drupal community ?
